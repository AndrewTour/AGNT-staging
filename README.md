# AGNT BETA v1.36.13 — Buyer Follow-Up Modal + Alignment

Incremental BETA update built directly on the confirmed working AGNT BETA v1.36.11 Buyer Context + Follow-Ups package supplied on 21 August 2026.

## Release baseline
- Application/UI source: confirmed working `AGNT-beta-v1.36.11-Buyer-Context-Follow-Ups.zip` (v1.36.11 baseline).
- Firebase environment: existing BETA project `daily-accountability-be0ac`.
- Existing Firebase Authentication accounts and UIDs are retained.
- Existing personal data remains under the current `users/{uid}` paths.
- Existing Team membership, invite-code and Team leaderboard paths are retained.
- No user-data migration is required.

## Included functionality
- Complete Team create/join/leave/owner-management workflow, including Team deletion.
- Daily and current-week Team leaderboard sync.
- Persistent Pipeline Session refresh with per-user/per-day served-contact exclusion.
- Broadcast contrast and viewport refinements.
- Universal nested/session navigation polish.
- Returning Daily Snapshot for four seconds on every second returning app open.
- Consumer-ready login with persistent Firebase authentication restore.
- Team appointment assignment after Book Appointment, defaulting to Me.
- Assignment choices use the live Team leaderboard display name and show first name only.
- The original setter keeps the appointment statistic and personal source appointment.
- The assigned teammate receives a Team-owned appointment mirror without another user writing into their private `users/{uid}` records.
- Recipient sees the appointment in their appointment/timeline surfaces without receiving the setter's appointment statistic.
- Live/next-open appointment notification with Got it and Add to Calendar.
- Setter-facing appointment/log/leaderboard context shows `Booked for [First name]` where applicable.
- Targeted dark-mode contrast fixes for appointment contact suggestions and Editing Appointment.

## Buyer journey added in v1.36.7
- Dedicated Buyers tab inside Prospector, separate from Contacts.
- Add as buyer from the quick-call/buyer-list call outcome flow.
- Fast buyer brief capture: budget, configuration, suburbs, property type and requirement tags.
- Buyer cards show requirement snapshots with one-tap Call and SMS actions.
- Quick and advanced buyer filtering by budget, suburb, configuration, property type, stage, temperature and requirements.
- Buyer journey stages: Looking, Inspecting and Negotiating, followed by Purchased/Owner conversion.
- Mark as Purchased converts the same record into an Owner contact while retaining buyer history and purchase details.
- Buyer records use the existing UID-scoped Prospector sync document; no new Firestore collection or rule is introduced.

## Buyer UI refinement added in v1.36.8
- Fixed Buyers-tab horizontal overflow and clipped content on iPhone-width viewports.
- Simplified the buyer database controls to All / Hot / Warm plus the existing advanced Filters control.
- Removed the duplicate in-panel + Buyer action; the existing Prospector + button remains the single add action.
- Shortened the buyer search placeholder so it remains readable beside the keypad and add controls.
- Buyer cards now use a containment-safe grid with compact Call/SMS actions beside the buyer name.
- Last-contact text now sits on its own contained line instead of competing with stage/temperature pills.
- Buyer overview, list and filter surfaces now use the same rounded nested-card geometry as the rest of AGNT.
- Buyer logic, data shape, filtering capability and Buyer → Owner conversion are unchanged.

## Buyer simplicity refinement added in v1.36.9
- Buyer database rows are now intentionally single-line: buyer name, maximum budget, Call and SMS.
- Buyers are sorted A–Z by name for fast scanning.
- Budget capture is now one maximum-budget slider; the previous minimum/maximum range UI is removed.
- Existing buyer records remain compatible; legacy minimum-budget data is only used as a fallback display value when no maximum was previously stored.
- New/edited buyer records save `buyerBudgetMin` as `0` and store the selected maximum in the existing `buyerBudgetMax` field, so no Firebase schema or migration is introduced.
- Buyer filtering now uses one `Buyer budget at least` slider, designed to find buyers whose maximum budget can meet a property price.
- The buyer suburb field now includes a preloaded searchable Sydney suburb list while still allowing manual suburb entry when required.
- Quick filters are reduced to All / Hot / Filters; stage, temperature, configuration, property type and requirements remain in advanced Filters.
- Buyer detail, call/SMS actions, call-result logging and Buyer → Owner conversion remain unchanged.

## Buyer UI balance refinement added in v1.36.10
- All / Hot / Warm / Filters now share the same width, height, font weight, border treatment and sit on one row.
- Warm is restored as a working quick filter while deeper stage, temperature and property matching remain in Filters.
- Buyer rows are shorter and more balanced: name and maximum budget share one clear hierarchy with smaller equal Call/SMS actions.
- Buyer list metadata and card spacing are tightened to reduce visual weight without removing information.
- Buyer suburb capture now reads `Add suburb`; its type size, weight and control height match the surrounding buyer form.
- The Sydney suburb autocomplete dataset and manual suburb fallback remain unchanged.
- No buyer data shape, Firebase path, rules, sync or Buyer → Owner behaviour changed.

## Buyer context + follow-ups added in v1.36.11
- Buyer list rows now surface maximum budget and the saved bedroom / bathroom / car configuration without using `+` suffixes.
- Buyer rows retain compact Call and SMS actions and add a third equal-weight `Follow Up` action.
- `Buyer Seller` is an optional buyer attribute indicating that the buyer has a property to sell if they purchase; it is editable on the buyer brief and displayed as a compact tag.
- Buyer follow-ups use the existing Prospector `nextFollowUp` and interaction sync channel rather than a new task collection or Firestore path.
- Follow-up creation captures a date and notes. Buyer follow-ups then appear on the existing Today timeline alongside Pipeline/appointment follow-ups.
- Completing a buyer follow-up from the Today timeline uses the existing Prospector follow-up completion pattern and clears the due task.
- No new Firebase collection, Firestore rule, local-storage key or backend service is introduced.

## Buyer context + contrast refinement added in v1.36.12
- Buyer maximum budgets now display as full dollar amounts, for example `$1,300,000`, instead of abbreviated `$1.3m` values.
- Buyer list context now keeps configuration and location on one compact line. The first-entered suburb is treated as the priority suburb and additional selections display as `+ X suburb(s)`.
- Buyer list, action buttons, search/filter controls and Buyer Seller tag receive explicit light- and dark-mode contrast treatment.
- Buyer follow-up overlay, sheet, fields, labels, close button and primary/secondary actions receive explicit opaque light/dark surfaces so the sheet remains clearly separated from the dimmed background.
- Buyer data shape, suburb ordering, follow-up task behaviour and Firebase architecture are unchanged.

## Firebase
The frontend is connected to the existing BETA Firebase project `daily-accountability-be0ac`.
The bundled `firestore.rules` is unchanged from the supplied v1.36.6 baseline, including its existing Team/private-data and Team appointment permissions.
No Firebase Console, Firestore rule or data migration change is required for this release. The bundled rules are retained unchanged from the supplied baseline.

## Protected systems retained
Existing Firebase/Auth UIDs, `users/{uid}` personal data, days, contacts, prospecting, appointments, notes/history, Team membership/leaderboard data, UID-scoped local cache shapes, offline Firestore sync, manifest/icon identity and service-worker behaviour remain preserved. Only release cache identifiers were bumped.


## Buyer follow-up modal + alignment refinement added in v1.36.13

- Buyer follow-up overlay now mounts at document level so it covers the full installed-PWA viewport consistently.
- Removed the heavy backdrop blur from the buyer follow-up overlay; uses the same restrained dimmed backdrop language as AGNT confirmation overlays.
- Follow-up card now uses contained AGNT rounded geometry with full light/dark mode surfaces.
- Follow-up date and note controls are explicitly constrained to the modal width, including iOS date input sizing.
- Buyer configuration/suburb context is left aligned directly beneath the buyer name while the full maximum budget remains right aligned.
- Buyer/follow-up data, Today timeline logic, Firebase, Firestore paths/rules, UID separation and sync remain unchanged.


## Buyer follow-up control + hierarchy refinement added in v1.36.14

- Restored the Buyer Follow Up modal to a broader mobile card footprint while retaining full viewport containment and AGNT rounded geometry.
- Rebalanced follow-up kicker, buyer name, labels, fields and actions so the modal hierarchy matches the surrounding AGNT UI.
- Added direct document-level modal controls so the close `×`, Cancel, backdrop tap and Escape key reliably dismiss the modal and return focus to the exact buyer screen/action that opened it.
- Buyer follow-up form submission is now handled directly by the document-level modal, preventing the body-mounted overlay from falling outside the Prospector form event scope.
- iOS date input sizing now uses explicit inline containment and native-safe sizing so it cannot extend beyond the modal card.
- Buyer/follow-up data, Today timeline behaviour, Firebase, Firestore paths/rules, UID separation and sync remain unchanged.
